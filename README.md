Dataset/Images From: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection/data

Learning how to do image classifcation and NN designing using brain tumor and MRI images. I also used this project to learn data augmentation and how to evaluate these models.

In the data file are various images of brain MRI scans of various patients with healthy and tumored brains. The images are sorted by no (w/o tumor) = 0 and yes (w/ tumor) = 1.
